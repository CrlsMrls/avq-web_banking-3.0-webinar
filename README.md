# Avaloq Angular Workshop

## Summary
In this workshop we introduce the Angular based solution from Avaloq by developing a web application that showcases configurable pre-built Banklets, internationalization, and theming capabilities.

The goal of this exercise is to address the following made-up requirement: 

> As a retail banking user, I want to list and check the payments from my bank account.

The application will therefore consist of three different views:
* an overview of the last “Recently executed payments” and the “Upcoming payments”,
* a list of all the existing payments with search functionality, and
* the detailed view of a single payment.

## Steps
These are the steps we will be going through. Each one of them represent incremental changes.
